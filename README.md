## Readme

This dataset is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset that can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones


The script in this repo (Script.R) combines the training and test sets into a full dataset to calculate means and standard deviation for all variables. (see variable description in CodeBook.md)
It then groups data by subject and activity to calculate again variable means. The result is stored in a tidy dataset in data/grouped_means.csv
